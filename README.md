# Portfolio-2.0

Here is the second iteration of my portfolio, having completed the first eight weeks of my twenty-four week Full Stack Development Coding Bootcamp.

Users see a section about me, a sample of some of my works, and can view those projects on github. My contact information and resume are also available.

HTML5, CSS3 (and JavaScript functionally) in conjunction with the Materialize framework, were used in the making of my portfolio.
